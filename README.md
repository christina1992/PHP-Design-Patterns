#The Active Record Pattern

The point of active-record is that it maps database rows into individual objects. Then than object is responsible for knowing how to create, retrieve, update, and delete the underlying database entry. 
The activee-record pattern is a simple data-access method that maps a databas table or view into an object. The fields map one to one, usually without modification.
